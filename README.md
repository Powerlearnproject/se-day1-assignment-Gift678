#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
     -Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems.
     -It is reliable in such that it ensures software performs as expected without bias especially for critical applications like healthcare ,finance. 
     -its efficiency helps in optimizing developer workflow while maintaining high quality standards.
     -it is secure such that it implements protection practice like authentication, authorization and encryption to secure users information.
     -it scalability and flexibility ensures that the system can handle an increased load without affecting performance.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
-Mastering complexity
-Mastering process
-Mastering machine


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
  - Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
  - Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  - Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  - Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
  - Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- Waterfall is a Sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall whlie  Agile is Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.
  waterfall, where there is Low flexibility, changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete, Customer feedback comes late after the product is developed and testing is done after end of development process
 Agile where there is high flexibility, adapts to changing requirements, regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint and testing is continuous and done after each iteration.
 
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
-Software Developer - developing applications,programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
 - maintaining and updating software to keep it functional. 
-Quality Assurance Engineer - collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement.
 - create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow
 - confirm that the software meets the requirement before deployment. 
-Project Manager - assembles and lead the software development team.
 - discuss the project and it's requirement with the client and software developers.
 - create blueprint for the project.
 - tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
-Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): It provides comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code e.g. Visual Studio
Version Control Systems (VCS): It helps in tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g., Git


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
  -Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
  - Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
  - Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
  - Strategies for Overcoming Challenges include: effective communication,
  -                                               -agile methodologies,
  -                                               -prioritization of tasks,
  -                                              -regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
is important in such that it ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.

  - Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
  - is important in such that it helps to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.

  - System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
  - is important in such that it helps to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security .
  - 
  - Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
  - is important in such that it formally tests to verify if a system satisfies business requirements


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
-Prompt engineering is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
-Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. 
-It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language modelsâ€™ training data.
-Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI.
 -Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models.
 
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

-Can you write something about social media?
-Can you write a 300-word blog post on how businesses can use Instagram to improve customer engagement, including three specific strategies and examples of successful brands?

-Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective:
Clarity:the action to be carried out is not hidden behind different meanings
Specificity: The improved prompt specifies the focus on "Instagram" and the topic of "improving customer engagement," making the task clear.
Conciseness: It asks for three strategies and examples, providing clear guidelines on what the content should include.

The improved prompt is more effective because it reduces ambiguity, sets clear expectations, and gives the recipient a concrete direction, making it easier to deliver a focused and relevant response
